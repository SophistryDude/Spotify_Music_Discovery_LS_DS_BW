# Spotify_Music_Discovery_LS_DS_BW
This is a Lambda school build week project - an app to recommend song suggestions based on data from the Spotify library. 

The spotify data set was already pretty clean, thankfully! 
Our app will take the name of a song from a user (potentially with some cool filters!!) and return some suggestions
based off of the spotify library. 
MVP will not involve API access.
We hope to add API access by the end of build-week - ideally expanding our "options of results"
from a few hundred thousand to many many millions!!
